  abstract = {The current research applies the SRI methodology in two typologies of typical residential buildings, Single-Family Houses and Multi-Family Houses, in five EU Countries, to evaluate the retrofitting cost towards buildings smartification and assess the SRI score when different retrofitting scenarios are applied. To that end, a three-step assessment process is adopted. First, the SRI is calculated for the baseline scenario representing the national minimum requirements according to the EPBD. Next, the SRI is calculated after applying a retrofitting scenario that includes market available technologies towards Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. Last, a more comprehensive retrofitting scenario of integrated technologies towards Positive Energy Buildings is assessed. Results indicate that buildings, constructed after the implementation of the EPBD, can increase smartness with a relatively low cost than older buildings, although their initial overall SRI score generally leads to an SRI Class G (0–20\%), with buildings performing better in “Health, well-being and accessibility” and “Comfort” impact categories. Smart-orientated retrofitting scenarios focusing on building automation and control measures can increase such buildings class up to “C” (65–80\%), performing better in optimizing energy efficiency when applying retrofits towards NZEB. Applying retrofitting scenarios that could potentially lead to energy positiveness mainly supports building interaction with the grid.},

  abstract = {The present paper suggests a procedure for identification of suitable models for the heat dynamics of a building. Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120m2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated.},

  abstract = {Electricity generation from wind power and other renewable energy sources is increasing, and their variability introduces new challenges to the power system. The emergence of smart grid technologies in recent years has seen a paradigm shift in redefining the electrical system of the future, in which controlled response of the demand side is used to balance fluctuations and intermittencies from the generation side. This paper presents a modeling framework for an integrated electricity system where loads become an additional resource. Agent-based modeling is used to represent a smart grid power system integrating generators, transmission, distribution, loads and market. The model incorporates generator and load controllers, allowing suppliers and demanders to bid into a Real-Time Pricing (RTP) electricity market. The modeling framework is applied to represent a physical demonstration project conducted on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA, and validation simulations are performed using actual dynamic data. Wind power is then introduced into the power generation mix illustrating the potential of demand response to mitigate the impact of wind power variability, primarily through thermostatically controlled loads. The results indicate that effective implementation of Demand Response (DR) to assist integration of variable renewable energy resources requires a diversity of loads to ensure functionality of the overall system.},

This paper summarizes this earlier adaptive comfort research, presents some of its findings for naturally ventilated buildings, and discusses the process of getting the ACS incorporated into Standard 55. We suggest ways the ACS could be used for the design, operation, or evaluation of buildings, and for research applications. We also use GIS mapping techniques to examine the energy-savings potential of the ACS on a regional scale across the US. Finally, we discuss related new directions for researchers and practitioners involved in the design of buildings and their environmental control systems.},

  abstract = {In buildings, there are two yet conflicting optimization goals: 1) minimize energy use and energy cost and 2) maximize thermal comfort. Model predictive control (MPC) is an ideal control strategy to deal with the above conflicting optimization goals. However, one challenge hindering the implementation of the MPC in buildings is the weather forecast uncertainty. This study aimed to improve the performance of the MPC under weather forecast uncertainty by introducing an error model. The error model used a straightforward approach based on easily measurable and accessible data to improve the quality of weather forecast data. The proposed method was tested by simulation on a university building located in Norway, while the detailed information and measured data from this real building were used to develop and validate the building model used in this study. Results showed that the MPC with the error model was able to achieve almost the full theoretical potential of the MPC in terms of the energy cost and thermal comfort, with 3.4\% of weekly energy cost saving and 73\% of indoor temperature violation numbers reduction compared to a conventional rule-based controller. In contrast, due to the existence of weather forecast error and a lack of error addressing mechanism, the MPC without error model did not perform well and gave the energy cost saving of only 0.7\% and the indoor temperature violation numbers even increased by 20\%. Meanwhile, the results indicated the introduction of the error model always benefited the MPC performance even under the condition of the low error of weather forecast. This study may facilitate the real application of the MPC in buildings.},

  abstract = {The crowded urban environment and busy traffic lead to heavy roadside pollutions in high-density cities, thereby causing health damages to city pedestrians. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered as a promising solution to such street-level air pollutions. Currently, in high-density cities, the number of public charging stations is limited, and they are far from enough to form a complete charging network with a high coverage ratio that can provide easy and convenient charging services for EV users. Concerns and worries on being unable to find a charging port when needed become a major hurdle to EV practical applications. Meanwhile, greener and cheaper renewable energy is recommended to replace fossil fuel-based grid energy that is commonly used in existing charging stations. Thus, this study proposes a novel Geographic Information System (GIS) assisted optimal design method for renewable powered EV charging stations in high-density cities. By selecting the optimal locations and optimal number of the renewable powered charging stations with the considerations of the existing charging stations and renewable potentials, the proposed method is able to minimize the life cycle cost of the charging stations while satisfying a user defined area coverage ratio. Using Hong Kong as an example, case studies have been conducted to verify the proposed design method. The design method can be used in practice to help high-density cities build their public charging networks with cost-effectiveness, which will promote EV practical applications and thus alleviate the roadside air pollutions in high-density cities.},

A prerequisite for this is a reduction in the distribution temperature and shift towards decentralized heat production. In this study, dynamic modeling has been applied to study the technical, energetic and environmental impacts of including prosumers e customers who both consume and produce heat e in a local low-temperature DH grid. Four different scenarios were studied for a planned building area in Trondheim, Norway: high- and low-temperature scenarios with the entire heat demand being covered by a heat central, and two low-temperature scenarios including heat supply from prosumers. A data center and two food retail stores were considered as the prosumers, each with different location and individual characteristics for the heat supply, allowing to study their impact on the water flow in different parts of the grid. The results show that utilizing local surplus heat is a significant measure to reduce the heat demand and the environmental impact of the DH grid. Decentralized heat supply additionally contributes to reduced heat losses, due to overall lower distances to transport the heat.},

A mathematical programming framework is developed for the operational planning of such energy supply chain networks. The minimization of total costs (including microgeneration system’s startup and operating costs as well as electricity production revenue, sales, and purchases), under full heat demand satisfaction, constitutes the objective function in this study. Additionally, an alternative microgrid structure that allows the heat interchange within subgroups of the overall microgrid is proposed, and the initial mathematical programming formulation is extended to deal with this new aspect. An illustrative example is presented in order to highlight the particular significance of selecting a proper optimization goal that thoroughly takes into account the major operational, technical and economic driven factors of the problem in question.

This paper presents a novel control algorithm for joint demand response management and thermal comfort optimization in microgrids equipped with renewable energy sources and energy storage units. The proposed work aims at covering two main gaps in current state-of-the-art demand response programs. The first gap is integrating the objective of matching energy generation and consumption with the occupant behavior and with the objective of guaranteeing thermal comfort of the occupants. The second gap is developing a scalable and robust demand response program. Large-scale nature of the optimization problem and robustness are achieved via a two-level supervisory closed-loop feedback strategy: at the lower level, each building of the microgrid employs a local closed-loop feedback controller that processes only local measurements; at the upper level, a centralized unit supervises and updates the local controllers with the aim of minimizing the aggregate energy cost and thermal discomfort of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a microgrid composed of three buildings, a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, and an energy storage unit. Comparisons with alternative demand response strategies reveal that the proposed strategy efficiently integrates the renewable sources; energy costs are reduced and at the same time thermal comfort of the occupants is guaranteed. Furthermore, robustness is proved via consistent improvements achieved under heterogeneous conditions (different occupancy schedules and different weather conditions).},

The framework is exemplified by way of a microgrid that is connected to an external grid via a transformer and includes the following players: a middle-size train station with integrated photovoltaic power production system, a small energy production plant composed of urban wind turbines, and a surrounding district including residences and small businesses. The system is described by Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), in which each player is modelled as an individual agent aiming at a particular goal, (i) decreasing its expenses for power purchase or (ii) increasing its revenues from power selling. The context in which the agents operate is uncertain due to the stochasticity of operational and environmental parameters, and the technical failures of the renewable power generators. The uncertain operational and environmental parameters of the microgrid are quantified in terms of Prediction Intervals (PIs) by a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) – trained Neural Network (NN). Under these uncertainties, each agent is seeking for optimal goal-directed actions planning by Robust Optimization (RO). The developed framework is shown to lead to an increase in system performance, evaluated in terms of typical reliability (adequacy) indicators for energy systems, such as Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) and Loss of Expected Energy (LOEE), in comparison with optimal planning based on expected values of the uncertain parameters.},

LEM is also presented in MCEMS−LEM to obtain the best purchasing price in Day-Ahead Market (DAM), as well as to maximize the utilization of existing DER. With regard to RTS, it must update and feedback the power set-points of DER by considering the results of DAS. The presented architecture is flexible and could be used for different configurations of MGs also in different scenarios. Simulations and experimental evaluations have been carried out using real data to test the performance and accuracy of the MG testbed. This paper aims to operate the MG in islanded mode, ensuring uninterruptable power supply services and reducing the global cost of generated power. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show a reduction in the generated power cost by almost 8.5\%.},

  abstract = {Building retrofitting towards nearly zero energy building (nZEB) with comfortable visual and thermal conditions, requires a comprehensive parametric analysis of building retrofit measures. This paper presented an optimization method to automate the procedure of finding the best combination of measures minimizing the building energy use and achieving the nZEB target while enhancing both thermal and visual comfort conditions. The study was performed by coupling of an Indoor climate and energy simulation software (IDA-ICE) and a generic optimization tool (GenOpt) through a Graphical Script interface and the optimization was applied to a typical office building located in Norway. The adopted method allowed the concurrent optimization of building envelope, building energy supply, fenestration, and shading device material, and control methods. Two constraint functions including visual and thermal comfort criteria were considered. Afterwards, PV panels were integrated with the building site for on-site production of electricity towards ZEB level. Findings demonstrated that the inclusive optimization approach could significantly decrease the building energy use, up to 77\%, and improve both the thermal and visual comfort simultaneously. Furthermore, the best performance for the optimal solution was achieved when the shading device and window opening control methods functioned with solar radiation and indoor air temperature setpoints.},

  abstract = {Through a systematic study, this paper conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) consisting of evaluation of both embodied and operational emissions of different building retrofitting scenarios for a typical office building, located in Norway. LCA analysis was performed via the OneClick LCA tool. The emissions associated with the operational energy use were evaluated for both the reference and optimized building energy models developed in the IDA-ICE models from our previous studies. These models included two different HVAC systems: an all-air (AA) system equipped with a demand control ventilation (DCV) and a hydronic system with the radiator space heating (RSH) and a constant air volume (CAV) ventilation system. The findings showed that, through retrofitting measures, the net total emissions could be reduced up to 52\%, from 1336–637~kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq)/m2, which was achieved for the life cycle cost (LCC) optimal scenario equipped with the AA system. The share of operational energy use (B6) in the total CO2-eq emissions was around 77\% for the reference case, whereas it was around 43–46\% for the retrofitting scenarios. The most embodied CO2-eq emitted stages of the LCA through retrofitting concerned the product stage (19–23\%), transport to construction site (24–31\%), and the end-of-life service (around 25\%). The findings confirmed that it was more environmentally friendly to further re-insulate the other parts of the building envelope instead of ground floor, as the latter retrofitting scenario was accompanied with a large increase of embodied emissions.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing need to invest in smart, energy-efficient technologies in buildings to improve health and convenience for occupants and to reduce energy consumption and carbon emission impacts. Digitalization and developments in the information and communication technology sector play a critical role in improving the efficiency of the European energy market and remaining in the current progress of sustainable and renewable energy systems. Therefore, the European Union Member States are required to establish an optional common scheme for defining and calculating a descriptor, called a smart readiness indicator to assess the capabilities of buildings to adapt their operation to the needs of the occupants and the electricity grid and to achieve more efficient operation. This indicator is calculated using a methodology proposed and developed by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy which depends to a great extent on various factors such as building type and climate conditions. The effectiveness of these parameters on the Smart Readiness Indicator is reflected by the weighting coefficients which need to be initially defined by the legislator. Therefore, the main step to assess the viability of this methodology, is to test it in different situations, i.e., various building types, climate conditions, etc. To this end, the proposed methodology is applied in two service buildings with different levels of energy and indoor environment quality performance located in an area with a Mediterranean climate. The possible effects of smart services and retrofit actions on indoor environment quality and energy performance in the buildings were assessed through energy simulation for two separate rooms in the buildings, a monitoring campaign and a survey to assess the occupants’ subjective opinion about the indoor environmental quality using the questionnaire proposed by the Centre for the Built Environment of the University of California. The results imply that, although the proposed methodology was able to recognise the overall characteristics of the sample buildings, some amendments are still required to capture the specific features of non-residential Mediterranean climate buildings. More specifically, the defined weighting factors fail to reflect the actual energy performance of the service buildings and need to be revised. Moreover, the current retrofitting actions which were implemented to improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort in the building were not as effective as expected in enhancing the SRI value.},

  abstract = {It is essential for the electricity sector to analyze and determine the distribution capacity throughput and apply new methods aimed at increasing the capacity of the transmission system. Consequently, the transition to modern electricity networks is two-sided, i.e., involving technological and social modifications. The demand response (DR) redistributes consumption away from peak times when grid load and costs are the highest. It incentivizes customers to use electricity when supply is high and inexpensive due to various market mechanisms. The present DR policy proposals stress the importance of fostering behavioral change through competitive pricing and customer participation in reducing carbon emissions and implementing smart energy solutions (including monitoring tools, such as smart meters and applications). The internet of things (IoT) has been applied to ensure adaptive monitoring of energy consumption and cost-effective and adequate demand-side management (DSM). The article is based on the research of the most recent sources of DR implementation methods applied at the power distribution level. It explains the main concepts, classifications, and entities implementing DSM programs, and suggests new visions and prospects for DSM and DR. Moreover, it discusses the application of blockchain technology potential for the internet of energy.},

This paper proposes detection methods to overcome these issues, based on the 4S3F (four types of symptom and three types of faults) framework. A set of generic symptoms divided into three categories (balance, energy performance and operational state symptoms) is discussed and related performance indicators are developed, using efficiencies, seasonal performance factors, capacities, and control and design-based operational indicators. The symptom detection method was applied successfully to the HVAC system of the building of The Hague University of Applied Sciences. Detection results on an annual, monthly and daily basis are discussed and compared.},

  abstract = {A smart grid power system with renewable energy resources and distributed energy storage shows significant improvement in the power system’s emission reduction, reliability, efficiency, and security. A microgrid is a smart grid in a small scale which can be stand-alone or grid-tied. Multi microgrids form a network with energy management and operational planning through two-way power flow and communication. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of a microgrid, a performance metric is proposed with consideration of the electricity price, emission, and service quality, each of them is given a weighting factor. Thus, the performance metric is flexible according to the consumers’ preference. With the weighting factors set in this paper, this performance metric is further applied on microgrids operated as stand-alone, grid-tied, and networked. Each microgrid consists of a solar panel, a hydrogen fuel cell stack, an electrolyzer, a hydrogen storage tank, and a load. For a stand-alone system, the load prediction lowers down the daily electricity consumption about 5.7\%, the quantity of H2 stored fluctuates in a wide range, and overall performance indexes increase with the solar panel size. In a grid-tied MG, the load prediction has a significant effect on the daily consumed electricity which drops 25\% in 4days, some day-time loads are shifted to the night time, and the capacity of hydrogen tank is lower than that in a stand-alone MG. In a network with multiple MGs, the control of the power distribution strongly affects the MG’s performance. However, the overall performance index instead of any specific index increases with the MG’s power generated from renewable energy resources.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the study of a large-scale integrated energy system (LSIES) consisting of distributed district heating and cooling units (DHCs) and wind power generation interconnected via a power grid. A multi-objective group search optimizer with adaptive covariance and Lévy flights (MGSO-ACL) is developed to optimize the power dispatch of the LSIES with the selected objectives compromising the competing benefits of both the power grid and the DHCs. Furthermore, a decision making method based on an evidential reasoning (ER) approach is used to determine a final optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by the MGSO-ACL. The ER takes into account both the multiple objectives and the multiple evaluation criteria representing the economy and reliability interests of the power grid and the DHCs. Simulation studies are conducted on an IEEE 30-bus system, which is modified to include distributed DHCs and wind power generation, to verify the effectiveness of the MGSO-ACL and ER. The results demonstrate that the MGSO-ACL can obtain superior Pareto-optimal solutions in terms of convergence and diversity, and the ER is pragmatic in handling the complex decision making problem, in particular for determining the final optimal solution of the power dispatch of the LSIES.},
